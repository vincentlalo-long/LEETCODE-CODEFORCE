ðŸ§  Algorithm Practice Repository

Welcome to my algorithm practice repository! This is where I keep track of my solutions to problems from LeetCode, Codeforces, and other platforms during my time in university.

ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Master algorithms and data structures  
- Prepare for programming contests and technical interviews
 ðŸ›  Contents

- ðŸ“‚ `leetcode/` â€“ Solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- ðŸ“‚ `codeforces/` â€“ Submissions and solutions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) contests
- ðŸ“‚ `notes/` *(if applicable)* â€“ Quick notes or tips about algorithms and problem-solving
ðŸ§© Languages Used

- Python 3  
- (You can add C++, Java, or others if you use more languages)


ðŸš€ Updates

I'll keep this repository updated regularly as I solve more problems and participate in contests.
